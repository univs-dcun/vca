         * Uncapped, a 1920px monitor gave the page ~1560px: the four metric cards stretched until
         * each was mostly empty, and the camera table's five columns drifted so far apart that a
         * row stopped reading as one row. A cap is what makes the whole screen a glance rather
         * than a scan.
         *
         * Found by walking it in: uncapped (~1560 of content on a 1920 monitor) the four cards
         * stretched until each was mostly empty; 1344 left 182px of margin each side and read as a
         * page floating in the window; 1504 was tight. 1600 leaves ~54px each side — enough that
         * the page has an edge, not so much that it looks parked in the middle.
         *
         * The cap is on the scrolling element itself rather than on an inner wrapper, because
         * Input Sources' sticky header measures this container to position its fixed copy — an
         * inner box would leave the header wider than the content it covers.
