// Portal-managed accounts — separate from `persons` (the VIP/watchlist registry). A PortalUser is
// someone who can log into this same app; `permission` decides whether they land in the Portal
// back-office shell or straight into the Smart City/School app (see PortalShell/ClientLayout),
// and `projectIds` scopes which project(s) an operator can see once inside the app.
/**
 * What an account can do in the PORTAL — this is a console role, not a product role.
 *
 * The distinction matters because one field used to answer two different questions at once
 * ("can this person open Portal?" and "what may they do in the monitoring app?"), which is why
 * splitting "operator" into manager/viewer never made sense: operator was never a console role,
 * it meant "no console".
 *
 * Console consoles model this as one ladder plus a read-only twin (Cloudflare's Domain
 * Administrator / Domain Administrator Read Only, Vanta's Admin / View-only Admin / Auditor), and
 * scope it by resource rather than inventing more roles — we scope with projectIds.
 *
 * - owner    최고관리자. The only role that can grant or revoke permissions, and the only one that
 *            can remove people. Kept to a named few; the app refuses to leave fewer than one.
 * - admin    관리자. Changes the installation's settings — cameras, VIP registry, roster, license —
 *            but cannot change who has access.
 * - auditor  읽기 전용 관리자. Sees every Portal screen and the audit log, changes nothing. For
 *            handover, inspection, and the customer's security officer.
 * - none     No console access at all.
 *
 * The fourth value used to be called "operator", which read as a console role and was not one — it
 * meant "no console, app instead", so it answered a question this field no longer owns. Whether a
 * person may use the monitoring app is now `appAccess`, an independent flag, because the two are
 * genuinely independent: an administrator who never opens the app, and an app user who is also
 * allowed to look at Portal, are both real and neither could be expressed while one field carried
 * both answers. "none" says only what it says.
 *
 * HANDOFF NOTE: the frontend only decides what to show and what to disable. Every mutating
 * endpoint has to check the caller's role again — see the auth-flow doc, section 07.

// ── BACKEND HANDOFF: everything from here down to personHitHistory()/addEvent()'s classification
// branch (search "distinctRecentCameras") is a CLIENT-SIDE STAND-IN for a decision a real
// recognition engine should be making. Today the frontend infers "is this a plain VIP sighting or
// a multi-camera Tracking trail" itself, per new event, from nothing but timestamps/camera keys
// in whatever's already in the store — the three window constants below (VIP_SESSION_WINDOW_MS,
// VIP_ACTIVITY_WINDOW_MS, TRACKING_CLASSIFICATION_WINDOW_MS) are its whole "business logic".
// Once a real backend supplies detections with their own classification already decided (e.g. a
// `personType`/"Tracking" flag and a ready-made multi-camera path per event), this entire
// merge/classify block should be DELETED, not adapted — addEvent should just append whatever the
// server already decided, the same way the `if (!event.personName || !event.location)` branch
// right below already does for generic non-person events. Keeping it until then, rather than
// ripping it out early, is what let this session simulate realistic-looking VIP/Tracking activity
// with no backend at all — but it's the single biggest "client is doing the server's job" piece
// in this codebase and shouldn't be extended further or copied elsewhere.
//
// A real recognition engine re-fires repeatedly while the same person lingers in one camera's
// frame — that's one continuous sighting, not N separate visits, so those re-fires should update
// the existing history row (bump its "last seen" time) rather than spam the list with duplicates.
// Only a gap LONGER than this counts as the person genuinely leaving and reappearing later, which

// plain "VIP Detection" row even if every hit since has been at the same single camera. Bounding

// at some point, and once they do, they stay classified as "Tracking" long after they've settled
// back into being seen at just one camera again. That's a one-way ratchet that empties out the
// plain "VIP Detection" rows entirely after a few hours of a session running, not something that
// only shows up after a real 24 hours. Classification (VIP vs. Tracking) instead looks only at
// this much shorter, ACTUAL-recent window — someone reverts to a plain VIP row once their
